# Restless Bandit's UI task

Welcome! This exercise is designed to let you show us how you work on a typical front-end task, in a way that's more representative of the real world than traditional whiteboard coding questions.

It should take no more than a couple of hours.

## The task

We've decided to explore a card-based layout for displaying candidates. Restless Bandit's algorithm has found and graded some hypothetical candidates, and our designer has created a mockup of how the layout should look (`card-layout.png` at the top level of this repo).

We're using React, and we've got the project set up and ready to go. In `src/App.js`, you'll find a basic `App` component with the page header and the candidate json available in the public directory. Your task is to build the rest of the UI shown in the mockup.

**What we're looking for:**

- Accurate translation of the design
- Clean, consistent code style
- Candidates sorted by their grade
- Tests for your components
- Add basic search bar functionality, which updates the visible list of candidates as you type

**Optional extensions (pick one if you want to, but it's not necessary):**

- Make the page responsive
- Add basic modal view when a user clicks on a candidate card
- Do something else cool/creative - it can be anything you like!

Feel free to add any libraries you would find useful (just be sure to `npm install --save` them).

## Workflow

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed (at least v6)
2. `cd rb-ui-task`
3. Run `npm install` to load in the necessary modules

Good luck!

## Running the app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
